This project demonstrates comprehensive testing techniques in **Spring Boot** using **JUnit** and **Mockito**. It covers unit testing, integration testing, and advanced testing strategies.

---

## Project Overview
This project contains examples of:
- Writing unit tests for Spring Boot applications
- Testing service, repository, and controller layers
- Mocking dependencies using Mockito
- Parameterized, repeated, and exception testing
- SQL/EntityManager integration testing
- Advanced mocking using Powermock, ArgumentCaptor, and custom matchers

---

## Technologies Used
- Java 17+
- Spring Boot 3.x
- JUnit 5
- Mockito 5.x
- Powermock (for private/static methods)
- Maven/Gradle (build tool)

---

## JUnit Topics Covered
- JUnit Basics
- Assertions (`assertEquals`, `assertTrue`, `assertThrows`, etc.)
- `@Before`, `@Rule`, `@TemporaryFolder`
- Exception testing
  - Basic
  - Enhanced with `CatchException`
- Parameterized tests
- Repeated tests

---

## Mockito Topics Covered
- `mock()`, `when()`, `thenReturn()`
- Stubs & Spies
- `verify()` & argument verification
- `@InjectMocks` & `@Mock`
- `ArgumentCaptor`
- Using `Answer` for dynamic stubbing
- Stubbing repeated calls
- Stubbing void methods
- Improving default Mockito values
- Mockito BDD style
- Argument matchers
- SQL/EntityManager testing (integration with persistence layer)
- Perfect stubbing (`thenReturn` vs `doReturn`)

---

## Advanced / Extra Topics
- Powermock for private & static methods
- AssertJ matchers
- Custom matchers
- IntelliJ tips for running test classes efficiently

---

## Conclusion
Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in **unit testing, integration testing, and advanced mocking** using **JUnit** and **Mockito** in a Spring Boot environment.  
I have learned how to write **robust, maintainable, and readable tests**, handle **exceptions**, use **parameterized and repeated tests**, and apply **advanced techniques** like **Powermock, ArgumentCaptor, and custom matchers**.  

These learnings have strengthened my understanding of **testing best practices** and prepared me to write **high-quality testable code** in real-world Spring Boot applications.
